# Better Rail Website

In this repository you'll be able to find the source code of the Better Rail website.  
The source code for the app itself can be found [here](https://github.com/guytepper/better-rail).

There's no build tools needed to build the website, it's just plain ol' HTML & CSS files.

If you're using VSCode, it's recommnded to use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension while developing, as it can provide you a local Server with live reload feature for static.
